\title{Simulate a single epidemic path}
\usage{
run_model(tmax, tbar, p, lambda, kappa, q, mbar, kappaq)
}
\value{
A list of tibbles, each one containing information about
new nodes generated from the previous ones. Effectively this is
a tree.
}
\description{
For information about input parameters, see the documentation for
\code{\link{add_layer}}. The function starts by generating a single
parent and its communicable period of random duration, and starting
at \code{t_infect = 0}. The function then builds a tree starting at
the initial node by iteratively calling \code{\link{add_layer}},
until it receives an empty tibble, which happens either when the
epidemic extinguishes, or all branches have extended beyond
\code{t_max}.
