\title{Compute paths from a list of trees}
\usage{
treelist_to_paths(treelist, tmax, equalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{treelist}{A list of lists. Each sublist corresponds to a
single tree (i.e. a simulated path). Each tree is itself a list
of tibbles, with one tibble for each depth level.}

\item{tmax}{A positive scalar. The cut point for paths.}

\item{equalize}{A logical scalar. If TRUE, make all paths end at
t_max by calling \code{\link{equalize_paths}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns \code{id_sim} (unique path
ID), \code{time}, \code{n_infected} (cumulative number infected
-- strictly increasing), \code{n_infectious} (number currently
infectious).
}
\description{
This function computes paths from all trees at once; it is much
faster than iterating over trees (e.g. as one would do using
\code{purrr::map}).
