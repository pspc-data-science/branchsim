\title{Renewal equation solution to the expectation of the Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) process over a random characteristic.}
\usage{
renewal_function(dMu, G = 1, Time_limit = 100, nstep = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{dMu}{The function dMu(t) defines mu(dt) = dMu(t) dt. Function as argument.}

\item{G}{A function that that defines the expectation of the random characteristic of interest. Set to G=1
by default (total number born). Function as argument.}

\item{nstep}{The number of steps for the integration. Default is 10^4.}

\item{T}{The maximum of the time interval for integration 0,T. Default is T =100.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the time steps with the solution to the renewal equation.
}
\description{
This function numerically solves the renewal equation for a CMJ process using the properties of the triple
(lambda_chi, xi_chi, chi). See appendix C of Branching Processes in Biology by Kimmel and Axelrod for more details.
Z = G(t) + int_0^t Z(t - u) mu(du)
