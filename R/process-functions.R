#' Compute paths from a list of trees
#'
#' This function computes paths from all trees at once; it is much
#' faster than iterating over trees (e.g. as one would do using
#' \code{purrr::map}).
#'
#' @param treelist A list of lists. Each sublist corresponds to a
#'     single tree (i.e. a simulated path). Each tree is itself a list
#'     of tibbles, with one tibble for each depth level.
#' @param tmax A positive scalar. The cut point for paths.
#' @param equalize A logical scalar. If TRUE, make all paths end at
#'     t_max by calling \code{\link{equalize_paths}}.
