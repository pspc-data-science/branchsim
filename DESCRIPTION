Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Jérôme",
             family = "Levesque",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "jerome.levesque@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca"),

Description: Simulates the propagation of an epidemic as a branching process. The model allows for the stochastic interruption of communicable periods to study the effect of contact tracing, for example.
